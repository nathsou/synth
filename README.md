# synth

A unified, self-contained FPGA toolchain written in Rust. It takes Verilog-2005
or RTLIL (for example from Amaranth) to a programmable bitstream in one tool, with
no Yosys, nextpnr, Python or vendor tools at runtime.

Initial targets, in order:

| Family | Parts | Reference boards |
|---|---|---|
| Lattice iCE40 | LP / HX / UltraPlus | Alchitry Cu (HX8K), Nandland Go Board (HX1K) |
| Xilinx Artix-7 | XC7A35T – XC7A200T | Nexys A7 (XC7A100T), Alchitry Au (XC7A35T) |
| Lattice ECP5 | LFE5U / LFE5UM / LFE5UM5G | deferred |

The goal is to match or beat vendor tools (iCEcube2/Radiant, Diamond, Vivado) on
resource use and Fmax, with deterministic, reproducible results.

```sh
cargo build --release
target/release/synth build design.v --top top \
  --device hx8k --package cb132 --pcf pins.pcf -o design.bin
```

## Status

**iCE40 works end to end.** Verilog-2005 elaboration, logic synthesis (AIG
with SAT sweeping, balancing, refactoring and structural choices; sequential
clean-up; LUT mapping, carry chains, block RAM inference), packing,
timing-driven placement and routing, static timing analysis and bitstream
generation are implemented for the iCE40 HX1K and HX8K.
[examples/](examples/README.md) has RISC-V systems for the Alchitry Cu
(Hazard3, 5-stage pipelined) and the Go Board (SERV), ready to program.

Every stage is checked by simulation against the source RTL on four RISC-V
cores (PicoRV32, SERV, DarkRISCV, Hazard3), and the bitstreams by simulating
the decoded configuration. Quality of results against Yosys + nextpnr on the
HX8K (`tools/qor.sh` compares synthesis alone on more designs):

| Design               | synth                | Yosys + nextpnr      |
|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| PicoRV32 SoC         | 1651 cells, 63 MHz   | 1588 cells, 66 MHz   |
| Hazard3 SoC (Cu)     | 2359 cells, 31 MHz   | 2278 cells, 35 MHz   |

Artix-7 is next.
